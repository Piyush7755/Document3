        <li>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league, contested by eight teams based out of eight
            different Indian cities. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007.
            It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme.  </li>
            
            <li> The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. 
                In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.
                According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$160 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.
                </li>
                
                <li> There have been thirteen seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the Mumbai Indians, who won the 2020 season. 
                    The venue for the 2020 season was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and games were played in the United Arab Emirates.</li>
